# Django_news_website
I have created a simple news website using the Django framework. The site has a side navigation bar and the main part of the screen.

On the navigation bar, you can switch between different tabs - "Home", "About Us", "News" and "Contacts".

The "News" tab displays records from the database, which can be viewed in more detail by clicking the "Details" button. You can also edit or delete them in the detailed view.

The sidebar has an "Add Entry" button that allows you to add an entry to the database using the user interface, and an "Account" button that takes you to the account management page.

The project has two applications:
1. "main" - to display the sidebar and navigation and informative tabs with static information.
2. "news" - for working with the "News" tab and the database.
3. "accounts" - the section is under development
